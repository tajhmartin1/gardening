        The zinnia elegans, or most notably known as the common zinnia,
        is one of the hardiest plants. Zinnias are a great starter flower
        because they are low maintenance and fast-growing. They are native
        to the Southwestern United States to South America.  Zinnias come
        in a wide variety of colors and shapes making them perfect for everyone!
