        <p>The Helianthus Annuus, or more commonly known as the sunflower, is part of the Asteraceae family.
             They are native to North America, 
            domesticated by Native Americans. Sunflowers come in a variety of colors such as the traditional yellow, but also red,
             black, white and black/striped.
             The Native Americans grounded or pounded the seeds into flour for
             cakes, mush or bread. In the 16th century, the plant was taken to Europe by Spanish explorers. For more

        <h2>Water Needs</h2>
        <p>Sunflowers require lots of water! They can tolerate some drought but for best results
             the soil should be kept moist. Watering deeply once a week should be sufficient. Sunflowers, like most plants,
              droop when they are thirsty. Generally, I like to wait until
              about half the leaves are droopy before I water.
