            The Helianthus Annuus, or more commonly known as the sunflower, is part of the Asteraceae family.
             They are native to North America, 
            domesticated by Native Americans. Sunflowers come in a variety of colors such as the traditional yellow, but also red,
             black, white and black/striped.
             The Native Americans grounded or pounded the seeds into flour for
             cakes, mush or bread. In the 16th century, the plant was taken to Europe by Spanish explorers. For more

            Care Needs

        <p>
            Sunflowers require lots of water! They can tolerate some drought but for best results
            the soil should be kept moist. Watering deeply once a week should be sufficient. Sunflowers, like most plants,
            droop when they are thirsty. Generally, I like to wait until
            about half the leaves are droopy before I water.

            suggests, sunflowers love the sun. They prefer 6-8 hours of full
            sunlight to survive. This means that sunflowers are difficult to grow indoors.
            Unfiltered light, like on the back porch, is the best choice.
